# Reactive Array

In order for a tracked array to be re-rendered, you must reassign the value of the array, and not simply change members of the array.  More info here: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.reactivity_fields

See the LWC js file where the working code is uncommented.  To see the non-working code, change the commenting.
